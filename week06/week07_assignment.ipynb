        "What I found interesting about this assignment is that it was a combination of elements that I could consider to be challenging, and elements that could be considered rather straightforward. The first part of creating the JSON structure was simple because it was possible to group personal information and grades with ease. However, I found the writing of functions more demanding since it involved addressing issues with JSON data and manipulating it for the right results by paying careful attention to the nested elements issue. The most interesting part in developing the above functions was in solving problems involved as implementing the functions needed understanding of data structures and capabilities of Python language. I also found one aspect a bit challenging, and that was to keep a strict check so that the output was precisely in the format that was expected by the algorithm. In summary, I am glad that I chosen the real data formats such as JSON and Python as strokes, because it helped me to reinforce the use of the tools that are widely applied in the real-life. All in all this assignment is a good practice for the coding activity and the abilities that require logical thinking to be used."
